# odata-array-filter
This library allows you to pass in an OData filter string and an array of objects, and returns a filtered array.  Useful
when creating a mock service over an existing OData service.

### Work in Progress
Only supporting a subset of the V3 spec so far.  See the _parser-test.js_ for an idea of what is currently supported.
More to come.
